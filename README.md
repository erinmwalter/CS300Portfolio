# CS300Portfolio

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, I had to write a variety of different data structures/algorithms in order to load, 
store, and be able to retrieve course data for a computer science department.
Some options we went through throughout the course were vectors (as well as different sorting methods for vectors), linked lists, binary trees,
and hash tables. I ultimately decided to use a binary tree for the final project to load and store my course data into
after taking into consideration the three things listed below.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
When looking at different possibilities for data structures to store this course data, I kept in mind a few things:
1) performance- how quickly could the computer load the data into the data structure, sort the data, and retrieve an item. 
Another thing to consider would be how will the speed be affected if many, many courses were added? Would the speed stay about the same,
or would it decrease dramatically as more items were added?
2) Maintainability- if the computer science needed to remove a number of courses or add many courses, how easy would it be 
within the data structure to accomplish this?
3)Repeatability- howe easy would it be for me to apply this data structure to the data set? As this was my first course
on data structures, while the first two items were more heavily considered, I also thought about this because I wanted to make sure
that for this project I could successfully load the course data into the data structure and that it would function correctly and not have any compile errors.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One thing that has been indispensible to me as a programmer is writing pseudocode. First because if I can write out what
I want the code to do in plain english without working about programming syntax, then I have a clear vision of what I want
each piece of code to accomplish. And second, because if I write it out in english and then encounter issues with the code,
I have an easier time searching for help or looking up answers to my issues because I know what I'm trying to accomplish.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to desigining software and developing programs?
This project has taught me to think about the data structures that I am designing and how they will function speed/efficiency wise
with a large set of data. When we were working on earlier activities, some of our data sets were 12,000 items large and so the
speed/efficiency really was able to be seen. Up until these activities, I hadn't worked with very large data sets ever, so I 
only had to think about how to store very small sets of data. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Each of our activities required us to use starter code that someone else had written. So I had to go in and learn what
each method in the program does and see how it was structured before adding my own code. This felt a lot like real life where
I may not be writing programs from scratch but only looking to make code run more smoothly or sorting out bugs in code.
It's also made me more aware that making comments in my code is very important not just for myself but even more importantly
for other people so they can pick up on what certain methods/lines of code are doing. Also, when we got our starter code for
each activity it was the same main program, just a different data structure class swapped in, so it really showed how easy it 
is to change data structures if you are able to make your code more modular and separate things out into classes.
